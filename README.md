# Expectations

Installation (v1.0 and up):
```julia
pkg> add Expectations
```

This is a package designed to simplify the process of taking expectations of functions of random variables! 

### Random Variables

The underlying distributions are objects from `Distributions.jl` (currently `<:UnivariateDistribution`).

### Quadrature Algorithms

We support different types of Gaussian quadrature (Gauss-Hermite, Gauss-Legendre, Gauss-Laguerre, etc.) based on the distribution, as well as some methods
with user-defined nodes (e.g., trapezoidal integration).

### Expectation Operator

The key object is the `expectation` function, which returns an operator:

```julia
dist = Normal()
E = expectation(dist)
E(x -> x)
```
For convenience, the operator can be applied directly to a function instead of being cached,
```julia
expectation(x->x^2, dist)
```

As a linear operator on vectors using the nodes of the distribution
```julia
dist = Normal()
E = expectation(dist)
x = nodes(E)
f(x) = x^2
E * f.(x) == dot(f.(x), weights(E))
```
